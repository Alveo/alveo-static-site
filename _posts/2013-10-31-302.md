  *HCS vLab*   
 project \[  
 <u>

 \] started in December 2012 and is expected to be completed and operational by July 2014. The  
  *HCS VLab*   
 builds upon collaborations set up during the very successful ARC (Australian Research Council)-funded HCS Network project\[  
 <u>

 \]; it is the first time such a project has been conducted in Australia and will benefit researchers from myriad disciplines encompassed by Human Communication Science (HCS).

 The  
  *HCS vLab*   
 is funded by NeCTAR, a body set up by the Australian Government as part of the Super Science initiative and financed by the Education Investment Fund.

- ##  Link data to tools
- ##  Provide a collaboration environment
- ##  Improve reusability and replicability of results

</object><details open="open"> Research conducted in isolation entails inefficient repetition of analysis of local data sets. HCS research in Australia, and successful real-life applications, requires going beyond the isolated desk-PC-lab-university-bound model of research into a new research environment. Such an environment will eradicate the waste involved in repeated unshared analyses; ignite the research spark that affords the serendipity of new tool-corpus combinations; and dramatically improve scientific replicability by moving corpora and tools and the analyses conducted with these into an easy access, shared, in-the-cloud, public, replicable environment.

 The aims are to:

 facilitate access by the Australian and international HCS communities to data and analysis tools;

 afford new toolâ€“corpus combinations and new emergent research output â€“projects, grant funding, doctoral theses, and publications;

 allow analysis and annotation results to be stored and shared, thus promoting collaboration between institutions and disciplines;

 improve scientific replicability by moving local and idiosyncratic desktop-based tools and data to an accessible, in-the-cloud, environment that standardises, defines, and captures procedures and data output so that research publications can be supported by re-runnable re-usable data and coded procedure (see, e.g., www.myexperiment.org/). The HCS vLab is designed to make use of national infrastructure â€“ including data storage, discovery and research computing services. It incorporates existing eResearch tools, adapted to work on shared infrastructure, with a data-discovery interface to connect researchers with data sets, orchestrated by a workflow engine with both web and command line interfaces to allow use by technical and non-technical researchers, via a Web interface.

Some of the licenses require data-owner approval. The entire lab is built around an Application Programming Interface (API) which respects the licenses and gives researchers access to data sets for which they are licensed, through the web, the workflow tool and via programmatic use of the API.

 \* Data storage

 \* A license manager, integrated with the indexing and storage

This allows for more flexibility than the sinple ‘canned’ tools built into the HCS vLab data web site.

 A similar approach will be used for audio and video data allowing researchers to create item lists, set some parameters and run analytical processes, resulting in new data sets or graphical plots.

 “This is a powerful tool and I think it is pretty good.”

 “I really liked using the system and the instructions were very easy to use and the system easy to navigate. \[…\] This platform would be very useful for my research.”

 “I think it’s quite easy to use. \[…\] Generally the platform is very clearly organised, and user-friendly.”

 “The platform overall is very good.”

 “Very nice platform with great user interface!”

 “A very promising and impressive setup so far!”

 “I’m impressed with the platform – it’s smooth and the interface is very intuitive.”
