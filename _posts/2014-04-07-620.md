</object> <details open="open">The Human Communication Science Virtual Laboratory (  
 *HCS vLab*   
) is a UWS-led project, funded by The National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources project (NeCTAR), an Australian Government Super Science project, regrouping almost 50 active researchers from 16 institutions., 10 such Virtual Labs across Australia. The project builds upon 2 previous UWS-administered projects: the 2000-member  
 *Human Communication Science Network*   
(HCSNet, ARC, RN0460284) and the 30-investigator, 12-institution  
 *Big Australian Speech Corpus*   
(ARC LIEF, LE100100211) and the ANDS funded Australian National Corpus project led by Griffith University. The main purpose of the  
 *HCS vLab*   
is to provide an environment that will foster inter-disciplinary research in Human Communication Science (HCS). While HCS is a broad field which encompasses speech science, speech technology, computer science, language technology, behavioural science, linguistics, music science, phonetics, phonology, sonics and acoustics, research is often conducted in isolation within each discipline. Too often the data sets used in research are difficult to share between researchers and even more between disciplines; tools are rarely shared across disciplines. HCS research in Australia, and the development of successful real-life applications, demands a new model of research, beyond that of the isolated desk/lab/university bound research environment. The  
 *HCS vLab*   
environment aims to eliminate the waste involved in repeated unshared analyses, provide the impetus for new collaborations, encourage new tool-data combinations, and improve scientific replicability by moving data and tools as well as the analyses conducted with these into an easily accessible, shared environment.

Architecturally, the  
 *HCS vLab*   
comprises a repository for heterogeneous data under a standardised metadata framework based on RDF, providing discovery services that allow researchers to create data sets that can be fed to a wide variety of research tools via a rich Application Programming Interface (API). Another major component is a workflow engine which allows data to be fed through a series of processing steps which can be stored and re-used. The  
 *HCS vLa*   
b will also orchestrate the creation of virtual environments including virtual servers pre-loaded with both a set of tools and data, as well as virtual High Performance Computing clusters.

This presentation will first cover the architecture of the  
 *HCS vLab*   
and give examples of its use across different kinds of data (text, audio, video) with a variety of tools. These include both ‘point and click’ pre-configured tools and a range of full programming environments in which data can be automatically marshalled for further processing. Examples include the Python-based Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text processing and EMU-R on the R-stats platform for speech processing and analysis. We will present in more detail the variety of corpora that have been made accessible and discuss the tools that are available for analysing these data sets, emphasising the novel use of some of these. The presentation will then report on experiences with new kinds of interdisciplinary research and demonstrate some research scenarios.

We will also discuss the potential for this approach and architecture to be adopted more generally in the digital humanities world, showing how new data and tools can be imported into the Virtual Lab environment, and how the tools can be used on data anywhere.

At UWS, Estival is the Project Manager of the Big ASC Project, establishing the audio-visual AusTalk corpus of Australian English, and of the HCS vLab. She is a founding member of the Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA) and in 2008 established the Australian Computation and Linguistic Olympiad (OzCLO).

Steve Cassidy is a Computer Scientist whose research covers the creation, management and exploitation of language resources. He is the main author of the Emu speech database system which is widely used in the creation and analysis of spoken language data for acoustic phonetics research. He has been involved in the standardisation of tools and formats for the exchange of language resources starting with his work on Emu and more recently as an invited expert on the ISO TC 37 working groups on annotation interchange formats and query languages for linguistic data. Cassidy is the Product Owner for the HCS vLab, acting as a conduit between the development team and prospective users around Australia as well as ensuring interoperability with related international efforts.

Peter Sefton is the Manager for eResearch at UWS. Before that he ran the Software Research and dDvelopment Laboratory at the Australian Digital Futures Institute at USQ. Following a PhD in computational linguistics, he has gained extensive experience in the higher education sector in leading the development of IT and business systems to support both learning and research. At USQ, Sefton was involved in the development of institutional repository infrastructure in Australia via the federally funded RUBRIC project and was a senior advisor to the CAIRSS repository support service from 2009 to 2011. He oversaw the creation of one of the core pieces of research data management infrastructure to be funded by the Australian National Data Service, consulting widely with libraries, IT, research offices and eResearch departments at a variety of institutions. The resulting Open Source research data catalogue application ReDBOX is now widely deployed at Australian universities. At UWS, Peter leads a team working with key stakeholders to implement university-wide eResearch infrastructure, including an institutional data repository, and collaborates widely with research communities on specific research challenges. His research interests include repositories, digital libraries, and the use of The Web in scholarly communication.

Denis Burnham is inaugural Director of MARCS Institute, UWS (1999-present) and President of the Australasian Speech Science and Technology Association (ASSTA, 2002-present). He conducts research in speech perception (auditory-visual, cross-language, infants, children, adults), special speech registers (to infants, pets, computers, foreigners), language development and literacy, human-machine interaction, and corpus management; has been continuously funded by the Australian Research Council since 1986; and has run various large projects, most recently this HCS vLab, the Big Australian Speech Corpus (Big ASC), the Human Communication Science research network, the Thinking Head Project, and the Seeds of Literacy Dyslexia project.

</object> <details open="open">A good way to get a an understanding of what the virtual lab can do is to have a look at this video by Steve Cassidy from Macquarie University. http://hcsvlab.org.au/2013/10/hcs-vlab-version-2-0-screencast/ </details></section><section><object data="http://bigasc.science.mq.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wpid-index.html_img6.jpg" height="150" width="300">#   **Data Discovery** 

</object> <details open="open">The laboratory has a data-discovery portal which houses a growing number of data sets. We originally called these ‘corpora’ but this turned out to a problem, as (a) many people don’t know what a corpus is or how to tell their corpus from their corpora and (b) it is specific to some disciplines, so these are now know as Collections. All the current collections in the lab require researchers to agree to a license, usually via web-click, some require an offline contract. This is not Open Data in the normal sense but given the terms under which most of the collections were collected this is the best we can do to make data available as broadly as possible.

</details></section><section><object data="http://bigasc.science.mq.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wpid-index.html_img7.jpg" height="150" width="300">#   **Discover data via metadata facets** 

</object> <details open="open">The discovery interface is very similar to that found on many DH services, it has faceted browsing and full-text search for resources. But this is not the main or sole function of the lab, the purpose is to allow people to DO things with data. </details></section><section><object data="http://bigasc.science.mq.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wpid-index.html_img8.jpg" height="150" width="300">#   **Architecture: Discovery leads to data** 

</object> <details open="open">The lab has a data-storage component which can look after large amounts of heterogeneous data, with any kind of digital resource stored against an item. </details></section><section><object data="http://bigasc.science.mq.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wpid-index.html_img9.jpg" height="150" width="300">#   **Including various media** 

</object> <details open="open">This is an example of speech data from the Mitchell and Delbridge corpus (data set) collected in the 1960s. </details></section><section><object data="http://bigasc.science.mq.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wpid-index.html_img10.jpg" height="150" width="300">#   **Post discovery: compile your own stable “Item Lists”** 

</object> <details open="open">Researchers can create their own sets of working-data from items in the repository, the discovery interface can be used to define and save an item list. Item list are stable, reusable and in future will be citable, they are NOT like saved searches. This contrasts with a saved-search in something like the National Library’s Trove service where the same search or API call might yield a different set of items on different days.

These are know as item lists and these are the key to re-doable research workflows as they allow the same stable data set to be run through multiple processes. Item lists are available via the web interface and via the API.

</details></section><section><object data="http://bigasc.science.mq.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wpid-index.html_img11.jpg" height="150" width="300">#   **Concordance: a tool run on an Item List** 

</object> <details open="open">Steve’s demo shows some example of simple, broadly useul text analysis tools that are built in to the HCS vLab data site. </details></section><section><object data="http://bigasc.science.mq.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wpid-index.html_img12.jpg" height="150" width="300">#   **API Access: Get a key** 

</object> <details open="open">All the data and discovery services available in the HCS vLab are available via the API, the Application Programming Interface. This is one of the key features of the lab, coupled with the stable, reusable Item Lists we looked at above, this is the key to openeing up data in new ways. </details></section><section><object data="http://bigasc.science.mq.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wpid-index.html_img13.jpg" height="150" width="300">#   **Copy-paste access to data** 

</object> <details open="open">Programmers are able to use Item Lists in custom code. The discovery interface makes this as easy as copy and paste (assuming that you’ve installed the software libaries you need in your programming interface). The API respects the access control of data collections in the lab, via a per-user private API key.

The aim of the ultimate aim lab is to make sure that you can do everything via the API.

</details></section><section><object data="http://bigasc.science.mq.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wpid-index.html_img14.jpg" height="150" width="300">#   **Workflow: Galaxy** 

</object> <details open="open">Like other NeCTAR virtual labs, HCS vLab uses the Galaxy workflow engine to allow researchers to construct research workflows that can be run over different data sets, and share them with others. In phase two of the project we will work on reusablity and reproducibility with research teams. </details></section><section><object data="http://bigasc.science.mq.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wpid-index.html_img15.jpg" height="150" width="300">#   **Chain processes on Item Lists – eg \[Tokenizer\] -&gt; \[Frequency List\]** 

</object> <details open="open">This simple demo show how an Item List is used in Galaxy, where multiple operations can be performed on data with each step feeding its result into the next one. This allows for more flexibility than the simple ‘canned’ tools built into the HCS vLab data web site. A similar approach will be used for audio and video data allowing researchers to create item lists, set some parameters and run analytical processes, resulting in new data sets or graphical plots.

</object> <details open="open">This particular workflow processes audio data using the  
[  
PsySound3 software toolkit (which was developed by Densil Cabrera, Emery Schubert and others to analyse sound recordings using physical and psychoacoustical algorithms). Given any audio recording as input, this workflow will perform an FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), Hilbert transform and Sound Level Meter analysis on the audio file and plot a graph for each one.  ](http://psysound.wikidot.com/)</details></section><section><object data="http://bigasc.science.mq.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wpid-index.html_img17.jpg" height="150" width="300">
</object> <details open="open">The second screenshot shows the plot resulting from one of the analyses performed – the FFT. The input audio file used in this example came from the Mitchell-Delbridge corpus (a database containing the recordings of Australian English as spoken by 7736 students at 330 schools across Australia, mostly collected in 1960). </details></section><section><object data="http://bigasc.science.mq.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wpid-index.html_img18.jpg" height="150" width="300">
</object> <details open="open">The lab also allows annotation of all kinds of materials including text and time-based media. At the moment this is accessible via the API. </details></section><section><object data="http://bigasc.science.mq.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wpid-index.html_img19.jpg" height="150" width="300">#   **Reuse**

</object> <details open="open">Call out to the partner network! If you are affiliated with one of the institutions above then we need your help to test the laboratory. We have money in the budget for testing by Higher Degree Research Students and potentially other testers. It’s worth getting to know the lab because of the huge potential it offers for new kinds of research, bringing together data that has not been joined-up before with tools that have been hard to access and use. Research is changing, with funders requesting data management plans be in place, and signaling that Open Access to data is likely to be mandated alongside Open Access to publications, the lab aims to assist researchers embracing this change.

</object> <details open="open">This is a picture of a dog\*. But what is it doing in this presentation?

(No it’s not a  
 *virtual*   
lab, it’s just a lab).

At the presentation I (Peter) asked the audience what they could tell about this dog from the picture. There were two interesting answers. Firstly it is male, which might be of interest in a biological virtual lab. Secondly someone said it is ‘happy’, which might be of interest in a Human Communications Science lab. A set of images like this may be an appropriate addition to the lab, studying how people react to non-human faces. Denis Burnham, who leads this project is a psychologist, and has been exploring ways that Alveo could be used to store re-usable sets of stimuli used in experiments, which are typically collected for a particular study and not made available for re-use.

The idea of looking at dog pictures is something I made up, but in phase two of the virtual lab, starting mid 2014, one of the tasks is to set up a board who to approve the addition of new data sets, they will be able to answer the question; dog pictures or no?

\* (it’s Daniel de Byl’s dog Merlin, and he took the photo which is used here with permission).

</object> <details open="open">Phase two of this project is about realizing the potential of the lab. We know what we will be doing to We’ll be:

\* Promoting its use to researchers and research communities via a variety of outreach activities

\* Supporting the lab via a combination of the UWS Service Desk and the AERO eResearch body

\* Continuing development of new features

\* And most importantly, we’ll be working on a sustainable model for the future. (Can it live-on through grants? Subscriptions? Partnerships with other similar projects?)
