This is one of a series of posts describing projects related to Alveo that might be suitable for Computer Science students to take on as a class project.

[SIDEKIT](http://www-lium.univ-lemans.fr/sidekit/index.html#) is a speech processing library from Anthony Larcher &amp; Kong Aik Lee &amp; Sylvain Meignier of LIUM, Universit√© du Maine in France.

The toolkit provides a Python interface to a collection of routines for speaker and language identification, including:

- Acoustic features extraction
- Modeling and classification
- Presentation of the results

This looks like a good candidate to be turned into a set of tools for the Galaxy workflow engine to allow speaker and language identification workflows to be developed. As an outcome of the project, the student could develop a number of workflows to illustrate speaker and language identification experiments that evaluate the performance of SIDEKIT on data from the Alveo platform.
