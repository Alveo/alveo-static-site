As of this morning (1st November) the Alveo server is offline. We are currently moving the server from its previous home at Intersect in Sydney to the facilities of NCI in Canberra. We had hoped to have a seamless transition between the two services but unfortunately the new server is not quite ready.

We will bring Alveo back online as soon as possible. All user accounts and collections should be maintained.

One major addition will be that for the first time we will have the full Austalk collection on Alveo. We’ve been working on finalising this collection for some time and this is the first opportunity we’ve had to get the entire collection ingested. When the server returns you should see over 850,000 items in the Austalk collection.
