I’m pleased to report that the Alveo server is now fully restored and all services should be working again as normal. AAF login is working again and password reset emails are now being delivered.

There is some work still in progress. In particular the Galaxy server will be updated soon with some more tools for manipulating speech data. We have been building tools to support workflows involving forced-alignment with MAUS and formant tracking with the Emu wrassp toolkit. These are now mostly working and we will deploy them as soon as we can. The use of Galaxy for speech and language analysis is a new development and we are still working out the best way to build tools and chain them together. When we have some tools available we’ll invite you to experiment and provide feedback so that we can hopefully build something that is generally useful to the community.
