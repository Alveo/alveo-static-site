The Alveo Virtual Laboratory is an eResearch project funded  
under the Australian Government NeCTAR program to build a platform for collaborative eResearch around  
data representing human communication and the tools that researchers use in their analysis. The human  
communication science field is broadly defined to encompass the study of language from various  
perspectives but also includes research on music and various other forms of human expression.  
This paper outlines the core architecture of the Alveo and in  
particular, highlights the web based API that provides access to data and  
tools to authenticated users.
