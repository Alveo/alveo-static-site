Data files can be directly uploaded into Galaxy / Alveo from your computer. They are then usable in the same way as data files imported from the Alveo Collections.

<div class="panel panel-warning"><div class="panel-heading">**Uploading data to Galaxy / Alveo is not the same as uploading data to Alveo.**The data you upload will only be available to you on Galaxy / Alveo, not via any Alveo feature. Alveo is a tool for discovering data in its pre-loaded Collections. There is currently no feature provided to upload data to Alveo.

- You can do this operation whether you have launched Galaxy from Alveo, or run it independently from the <http://galaxy.alveo.edu.au/> URL.
- If you prefer, you can click <button class="btn btn-default" type="button">Choose File</button> in preference to dragging a file from your computer’s file explorer.
