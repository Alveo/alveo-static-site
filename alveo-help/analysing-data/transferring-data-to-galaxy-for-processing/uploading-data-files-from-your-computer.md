Data files can be directly uploaded into Galaxy / Alveo from your computer. They are then usable in the same way as data files imported from the Alveo Collections.

**Uploading data to Galaxy / Alveo is not the same as uploading data to Alveo.**The data you upload will only be available to you on Galaxy / Alveo, not via any Alveo feature. Alveo is a tool for discovering data in its pre-loaded Collections. There is currently no feature provided to upload data to Alveo.





To Upload Data Files from your Computer…

- **Click** Load Data above the Tools column at the left of the Galaxy screen. The dialog shown below will be displayed.
- **Drag** a file from your computer’s file explorer and drop it onto this window. They file’s name and size will be shown in a new line in the table.
- **Drag** additional files into this window if you want to upload multiple files. Each file is shown on a new line.
- **Select** the options you require for each file from the **Type**, **Genome** and **Space &gt; Tab** controls.
- **Click** Start to start the upload process. All of the listed files are uploaded.

- You can do this operation whether you have launched Galaxy from Alveo, or run it independently from the  URL.
- If you prefer, you can click Choose File in preference to dragging a file from your computer’s file explorer.
