## **Launching Galaxy / Alveo**

You can access the Galaxy server from the link in the menu bar on the Alveo site, or just enter the URL http://galaxy.alveo.edu.au/ directly.

To work with Alveo data on Galaxy, use the Alveo tools to transfer item lists and documents to the Galaxy server. The main tools you will need to use are:

- **Store Alveo API Key** – stores your API key so that other tools can use it
- **Import Item List Names** Retrieves the list of Item Lists from Alveo


- **Get Item URLs for Item List** Retrieves Item URLs from an Alveo Item List


- **Get Alveo Data for Items Downloads** files from the items in an Galaxy list of items



The following video shows how to use these tools to get a set of files uploaded to Galaxy.
