You can download all of the data in an Item List to your computer as a Bagit ZIP file.

Bagit is a simple ZIP file format, which contains a directory structure based on the Items in your Items List and the Documents in each Item. You can find information about the Bagit format and further links on the Wikipedia [Bagit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt) page.

- The top level of the ZIP file has some .TXT files containing information files about the BAGIT format and this ZIP file in particular.
- The JSON format stores key/value pairs. It is (somewhat) human readable, but the most convenient way to directly view it is to use a JSON plug-in for your browser. There are many available. There are also many JSON readers available for a wide variety of programming languages, which permit automatic processing of these files. The instructions for installing the R environment for EMU/R include an instruction to install a JSON reading package. Information about JSON can be found at .
