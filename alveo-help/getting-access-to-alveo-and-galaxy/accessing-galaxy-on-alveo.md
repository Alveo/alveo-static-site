Galaxy is used for some Alveo data analysis functions. For these functions to work, you will need a Galaxy / Alveo account, which can be created easily the first time you attempt to use Galaxy from Alveo. It can also be done in advance by directly entering the Galaxy / Alveo URL, as explained here.

**To create a Galaxy / Alveo account in advance…**

- **Go to**  to see the Galaxy / Alveo login screen (shown below).
- **Click** on the underlined text to create a new Galaxy / Alveo account (as shown below). The new user screen will be shown.
- **Enter** your email address and a password. The email address should be the same as your Alveo email address, but it is a good idea to make the password different.
- **Click** Submit. An account will be created and you will be logged into Galaxy / Alveo immediately.
