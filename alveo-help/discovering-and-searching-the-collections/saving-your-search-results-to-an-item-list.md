Once you have the list of Items you require, you can save this list as a named Item List which can become the basis for further research. For example, you might go on to do a concordance search within your Item List or send your Item List for analysis using Galaxy / Alveo or Emu/R.

You can build an Item List from a single search or add to it incrementally from different searches.

Item Lists can also be shared with other Alveo users.

## **Saving the Entire List**

Click on Add All to List  to save your displayed Items to an Item List. A dropdown menu is displayed to allow you to select the whether you want to create a new Item List or append these Items to an existing one.
