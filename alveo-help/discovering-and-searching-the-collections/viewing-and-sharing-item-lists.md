New Item Lists can be created by clicking **Discover** in the Navigation Bar and using the Searching functions. See [Searching and Selecting Items in the Collections](/alveo-help/discovering-and-searching-the-collections/searching-and-selecting-items-in-the-collections "Searching and Selecting Items in the Collections").

When you click on **Item List** in the Navigation Bar, all Item Lists available to you are shown in the left of the Item List screen.

## **Shared Item Lists**

Whenever you view a Shared Item List, you will be shown only those Items from Collections for which you are licensed.

 **To Share your own Item Lists with everyone…**

- **Click** on the Item List you want to share.
- **Click** on Item List Actions to display a drop-down menu.
- **Select Share**. The small world icon next to the Item List name will become black.



Stopping sharing an Item List is just the reverse process.
