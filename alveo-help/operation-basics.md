## **The Main Screen**

Alveo’s main screen has four important elements:

![ScreenBasics](/assets/files/2014/07/ScreenBasics.png)

The **Navigation Bar** which includes your email address – it’s always the same, no matter what screen you’re displaying. It’s even similar before you log in, when you display the Alveo web site and for this Alveo Help.

- - Click **Discover**, **Item Lists** or **Collections** to change what is displayed in the Operation Area.
    - Clicking on the Alveo icon is the same as clicking on **Discover**.
    - Click on your email address to see the Administration options menu.

The **Operation Area** – which reflects the Navigation item you have clicked.

The **Funder Acknowledgement** area recognises the funding source for the Alveo project.

The **Program Version** info – which shows the Alveo program version you’re connected to.

## **Using the Alveo API**

In addition to the Alveo web user interface, the Alveo Collections can be accessed programmatically using the Alveo HTTP API as described in the [HTTP API Reference](/alveo-help/http-api-reference) page of this help. This API is used by both Galaxy / Alveo and by the EMU R Library functions which extract data from Alveo.

Use of this API requires an API Key. See [What’s an API Key?](/alveo-help/getting-access-to-alveo-and-galaxy/whats-an-api-key "What's an API Key?") for more information about your API Key.
