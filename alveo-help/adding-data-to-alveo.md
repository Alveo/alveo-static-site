Alveo is a repository for research data for the community and we hope that you will contribute your data as well as making use of the data we already hold. There are three ways that you can share data with others through Alveo:

- You can upload and share your own data by [creating a collection](http://alveo.edu.au/help/adding-data-to-alveo/create-a-collection/).
- You can share annotations or other files that you have created based on existing collections as an [annotation contribution](http://alveo.edu.au/help/adding-data-to-alveo/contributions/).
- You can [share your item lists](http://alveo.edu.au/help/discovering-and-searching-the-collections/viewing-and-sharing-item-lists/) with other users.
