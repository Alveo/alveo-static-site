Alveo provides two functions to help you investigate word frequency and context in all of the text documents of your currently displayed Item List.

## **Concordance**

The Concordance option finds matches with a single word from all text documents in the Item List. It does not search the Metadata.

To do a concordance word search…

- **Select Item Lists** from the Alveo Navigation Bar.
- **Click** on the Item List that you want to do your Concordance search in.
- **Click** on the Concordance/Frequency button and select **Concordance** from the dropdown list. The other contents of the control change to show only one other field with the words Search term… displayed in it.
- **Click** in the Search term… box and type in one word only. (Concordance does not support mutliple words in this box.)
- **Click** on the magnifying glass, or press Enter. All Documents in the current Item List will be searched for all occurrences of this word and their context will be displayed, as shown here.

## **Word Frequency**

This option lets you determine the frequency of occurrence of a nominated word or words in your currently displayed Item List and tabulate it by a nominated Metadata Facet.

To list a word’s frequency…

- **Click** on **Item Lists** in the Alveo Navigation Bar.
- **Select** the Item List you wish to invsestigate.
- **Click** in the Concordance/Frequency control and select **Frequency** from the dropdown list (if it is not already selected). The other contents of the control change to show two other fields.
- **Click** in the middle question box (which shows **Collection** by default) and from the dropdown list select the Metadata Facet by which you want the word frequency broken down.
- **Click** in the last question box (which shows Search List…) and type in the word or words you want to search for. (You cannot enter a complex search term here, just a simple list of words with spaces between them.)
- **Click** on the magnifying glass or press Enter. The results of the frequency analysis will be displayed, as shown here.



There are five Items in the “Cats and Dogs” Item List, which was used for this example.
