## Introduction to Alveo

This tutorial covers the main functionality of Alveo in four parts. Part 1 introduces you to Alveo itself: how to log in, the interface, searching and accessing data, sorting data into lists and running basic frequency and concordance analyses. Part 2 introduces Galaxy, and shows how to import your datafile lists into Galaxy. Part 3 shows you how to use the rich repertoire of tools in Galaxy to run more complex analyses on your data. Finally, Part 4 shows you how to combine your tools into Workflows which can be run repeatably over more datasets, and how you can share your Workflows with other researchers.

## [Creating Collections and Uploading Data](creating-collections-and-uploading-data)

In addition to providing you with access to public, open access corpora and datasets, and conditional access corpora for you to search and analyse, Alveo also allows you to upload your own datasets and optionally make them available for other researchers to access.

This tutorial covers the creating of collections, items, the uploading of documents, and the adding of metadata to your collections using the web interface.

**Please note:** This tutorial only covers the web interface to contributing data to Alveo. It is also possible to contribute data using the API, this will be documented in a future tutorial.

## [Accessing AusTalk in Alveo](accessing-austalk-in-alveo)

[Austalk](http://bigasc.edu.au/) is a large collection of spoken Australian English collected in the last few years at sites around Australia. When the collection is complete it will have close to 1000 speakers each with a range of recordings from isolated words to interview and map task recordings. Alveo contains most of the data and will have the complete corpus when collection and data processing is complete.

This tutorial will show you how to navigate through the Austalk collection in Alveo and use the advanced search functionality of Alveo to find useful data.
